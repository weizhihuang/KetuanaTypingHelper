# TW_TypingHelper

Hey guys, I made a typing helper with AutoHotkey to improve typing experience when input is not in Japanese or English.
It will only take effect when the Ketuana window is focused.

Usage: Just type "\" and an input box will appear. Type in what you want to say and send.

NOTICE 1: The clipboard will be overwritten.
NOTICE 2: Enter key is required, remember to check the content to be sent.
NOTICE 3: It's safe. If you don't trust anyone on the internet (yes, you should), you can compile it yourself.


我做了一個在天翼之鍊中輸入非英日文語系的小工具，只要在遊戲內按下"\"鍵即會跳出一個視窗，輸入文字並送出即可達到在遊戲內打字的效果。
